/*You will probably not have to take destructuring to such a level as this but this is for you to really wrap your brains around the mechanics.
EVERY EXERCISE SHOULD USE DESTRUCTURING*/


1. let arr = [
   ['name', 'jon'],
   ['age', 20],
   ['eyes', 'blue'],
   ];
 //Create an object out of the arr above then using destructuring, declare variables using the object keys.
 
 
2. 
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  //a. Set 3 variables names: the third index should be called 'three', the fourth item 'four' and the rest of the items thereafter 'rest'
  //b. Swap the third and fourth item variable values
